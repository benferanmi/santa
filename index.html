        They say some people are volcanic—driven by chaos under the surface,
        always moments from eruption. If you read my article

          ><em>Going Nuclear</em></a
        >, you'll know exactly how I mean. However, that's not me; not really.
      </p>
      <p>
        My nickname is "Lava" but my heat doesn't destroy, it transforms. When I
        began writing the <em>Herd Immunity</em> book in the spring of 2020, my
        goal wasn't to create a self-actualization movement. It was a joke
        project while the world was shut down. However, once I began to walk
        through my own life lessons and processes, I noticed a deeper
        transformation occurring. After facing my own mortality, my father's
        death, and my inability to be present and process grief, I felt stunted
        and impotent, and at times, a slave to my base emotions. I felt things,
        but I lacked the emotional vocabulary to describe them. This changed
        with my spiritual journey. The process was slow, but eventually, like a
        volcano, all of those emotions boiled under the surface until one day, I
        could no longer hold them in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lava isn't an explosion, it's a slow, inevitable process of becoming. It
        reshapes the land it touches. It burns away the false, carves out the
        real, and hardens into real ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this journey, my brain has moved from a place of snap
        judgment to empathy. As such, the writings on this page not only reflect
        the old way in which I saw the world, but as a natural evolution of my
        spiritual journey from sleepwalking through life to living with greater
        purpose.

        Like the phoenix, I don't believe in controlling human nature through
        shame, guilt, or fear. We are organic, purposeful, and intelligent. We
        don't need to be repressed; we need to be realized. I am Lava because I
        move slowly, deliberately, and irreversibly. The phoenix is my avatar
        because I faced death and have been reborn better, intuitive, and with
        greater purpose.

        From Ashes to Origin: My Path Begins
      </h3>
      <p>
        When I was 21, I walked into a tattoo shop and etched my second mark
        into my skin: A Phoenix—wings spread wide, flames licking its
        silhouette. Beneath the feathers, my grandparents' initials rest
        quietly, like embers buried in ash. My parents separated before I was
        conscious, and because both parents worked, my grandparents were the
        only people I felt safe around. I didn't understand it then, but the
        Phoenix wasn't just the symbol of remembrance. It was a prophecy.

        My name is J "Lava" Leffel, and I am fire sign to the core. "Lava" isn't
        some hokey PUA moniker or edgy online alias, it's a nickname that has
        become a point of pride and identity. During the COVID lockdowns (while
        I was brainstorming <em>Herd Immunity</em>), we were doing sales
        trainings via Zoom. My lava lamps were in the background. One day, my
        sales trainer called me "Lava," and it stuck. Like most things born in
        fire, it had a way of claiming space. I wear lava rock bracelets on my
        wrists; I wear a Tree of Life pendant and an ankh—symbols of
        regeneration, immortality, and balance.

        In November 2020, I walked away from a brakes failure and car fire that
        should have killed me. The next morning, my father passed away in his
        sleep, succumbing to cancer. My entire family lineage was almost
        destroyed in a period of a few hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        That moment—like so many I ignored before—was a flare from the deeper
        self, trying to get out. The man I needed to burn so that J "Lava"
        Leffel could finally emerge. I escaped my physical death, but it was the
        first of many ego deaths on my journey of becoming…

          <em>The phœnix (which is the mythological Persian </em>roc<em

            has both an astronomical and an astrological significance. In all

            Romans, and the peacock of the Far East. To the ancient mystics the
            phœnix was a most appropriate symbol of the immortality of the human
            soul, for just as the phœnix was reborn out of its own dead self
            seven times seven, so again and again the spiritual nature of man

        The phoenix isn't just an avatar or a trendy symbol for resilience. It's
        the ancient emblem of spiritual alchemy. In
        <em>The Secret Teachings of All Ages</em>, Manly P. Hall writes, "In the
        Mysteries, it was customary to refer to initiates as
        <em>phœnixes </em>or<em> men who had been born again, </em>for just as
        physical birth gives man consciousness in the physical world, so the
        neophyte, after nine degrees in the womb of the Mysteries, was born into
        a consciousness of the spiritual world."
        <sup><a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> That
        regenerative fire isn't comfort, it's confrontation. From an early age,
        I've made confrontation my playground. Between a playground bully, an
        internet troll, or being steeped in deviance decision-making,
        confrontation is my various breads and butters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regenerative fire is the soul reclaiming itself through destruction, ego
        deaths, and the end of false-identities. Through
        <em>Herd Immunity</em> and my social media history, I became world-class
        at calling out others' shortcomings, but the time came to call out my
        own. My writings were the vehicle for this. I was calling out society
        for its foibles, but within that regenerative fire, I had to turn the
        pointed finger inward.
      </p>

        According to Gnostic teachings, the Phoenix represents the eternal
        soul's ability to transcend time and illusion, dying not once, but
        repeatedly as it sheds layers of falsehood and returns to its essential
        self. "This mythical bird rises anew from its ashes after undergoing
        fiery trials—metaphorically illustrating how individuals can emerge
        transformed after facing personal hardships &amp; challenges encountered
        during their own journeys toward spiritual awakening."<sup

        Speaking of spiritual awakening, the Qabbalists have a name for the
        Supreme Deity, "signifying the expanse of the heavens, or spiritual
        fiery waters. <em>Schamayim </em>is 'The Ocean of Spirit,' within which
        all created and uncreated things exist and by the life of which they are
        animated. In the lower worlds <em>Schamayim </em>becomes the astral
        light."
        <sup><a id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> It's not
        enough to say we are beings of light or "made of stars" to cite Moby.
        <sup><a id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> Some argue
        we are made of spiritual fiery waters and that we don't die, we are just
        recreated within the universe.

        The Two-Headed Phoenix: Death and Desire

      <p>
        The double-headed Phoenix, as described in esoteric traditions, is a
        reminder that spiritual transformation isn't about blind optimism. It's
        about witnessing your own funeral <em>and choosing</em> to walk away.
        One head looks back, mourning what was; the other looks forward, burning
        with what could be. As <em>SpiritualMojo</em> puts it:

        Writing the <em>Herd Immunity </em>series has become that for me. Every
        page kills another part of whom I used to be—addicted to hyperreality,
        chasing illusions, hiding behind vices and dopamine scrolls. The work is
        a crucible; the book itself is fire. And every time I author another
        work, I'm changed. Regeneration "is the key to spiritual existence…a
        redemption of man through the union of a lower temporal nature with a
        higher eternal figure."<sup

        It sounds pretentious, but so does the notion of physical reincarnation.
        The birth of my spiritual understanding of the universe occurred after
        the death of my literal, bookish knowledge of existence.

        Whether the medieval practitioners of alchemy meant alchemy to be a
        discussion of the literal transmutation of metal or a metaphysical
        transformation of the soul is heavily debated. Manly P. Hall discussed
        this while researching the plurality of information regarding the
        origins of the Rosicrucian Order: "…adepts possessed the secret of the
        Philosopher's Stone and knew the process of transmuting the base metals
        into gold, but taught that these were only allegorical terms concealing
        the true mystery of human regeneration through the transmutation of the
        'base elements' of man's lower nature into the 'gold' of intellectual
        and spiritual realization."<sup

        He also directly cites the <em>Confessio Fraternitatis, </em>a sacred
        Rosicrucian tome<em>:</em>

      <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

          <em
            >When to a man is given power to heal disease, to overcome poverty,
            and to reach a position of worldly dignity, that man is beset by
            numerous temptations and unless he possesses true knowledge and full
            understanding, he will become a terrible menace to mankind. The
            alchemist who attains to the art of transmuting base metals can do
            all manner of evil unless his understanding be as great as his
            self-created wealth.</em

      <p>
        Hall also argues that a popular theory of Rosicrucian origins is that
        Sir Francis Bacon had a hand in writing the <em>Fama</em> and the
        <em>Confessio Fraternitatis,</em> "on the basis that the rhetorical
        style of these works is similar to that of Bacon's
        <em>New Atlantis</em>."<sup

        As a fan of Bacon and of renegades, I could see many of my favorite
        authors being "illuminated" or having belonged to the ancient Mysteries.
        It's also argued that Hall himself was a 33<sup>rd</sup> degree Mason.
        While I don't belong to any of these societies, nor was I schooled in
        the ancient Mysteries, as a historian and philosopher I see value in
        learning from both the ancient and modern philosophers. I can't just
        cite <em>Seinfeld</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em> all the time…
